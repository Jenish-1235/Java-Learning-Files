         * types of operators:-
         * 
         * 1. Binary operator:-
         *      a. +
         *      b. -
         *      c. *
         *      d./
         *      e.%
         * 2. unary operators:- 
         *      ++ , --  ---> increment and decrement operator
         * 
         * pre and post:- 
         * pre changes value first and then uses it 
         * post uses value first and then change it.
         * 
         * 
         * 3. Relational operators:- 
         *      a. == : equal to 
         *      b. != :- not equal to  
         *      c. > :- greater than
         *      d. <
         *      e. <=
         *      f. >=
         * 
         * 4. Logical operator
         *      a. && LOGICAL  AND
         *      b. || LOGICAL OR
         *      c. ! LOGICAL NOT
         * 
         * 
         * 5.  Bitwise Operators:-  true is 1 and false is 0
         * 
         *       &
         *        |
         *       ^
         *       ~
         *       >>
         *       <<
         * 
         * 
         * 6. Assignment Operators:-
         * a. ==
         * b.+=
         * c. -=
         * d.*=
         * e./=
